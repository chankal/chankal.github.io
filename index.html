                Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Chandini Kalidindi and I am a first-year CS Major. My threads are Information-Internetworks and People. I am passionate about volunteering and connecting with the community around me. I am heavily involved in Girl Scouts of America and the Connecticut chapter of VTSEVA! I hope that by joining the Dev Bootcamp by Bits of Good I will learn valuable skills to help non-profits and communities around me through CS. I am especially excited to learn how I can reach a wider audience with technology!
